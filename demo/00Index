constrained_optim	Demonstrate creating and using constrained portfolio optimization using the dataset 'edhec'.  Includes examples of both DEoptim and random portfolio optimization.
sortino             Maximize the Sortino Ratio of the portfolio 
testing_ROI  Demonstrate creating constraint object and solve five basic convex portfolio optimization problems with ROI using the 'edhec' dataset.
testing_pso  Demonstrate creating constraint object and solve portfolio optimization problems with pso using the 'edhec' dataset.  These sample problems are similar to those used in testing_ROI, so that one can compare solutions easily.
testing_GenSA  Demonstrate creating the constraint object and solve portfolio optimization problems with GenSA using the 'edhec' datset.  These sample problems are similar to those used in testing_ROI, so that one can compare solutions easily.
demo_ROI Demonstrate constraints and objectives that can be solved with ROI.
demo_DEoptim Demonstrate solving portfolio optimization problems using DEoptim as the solver. The demo solvers 4 problems: 1) Maximize mean return per unit mETL 2) Minimize annualized standard deviation 3) Minimize annualized standard deviation with equal contribution to risk using standard deviation as the risk measure 4) Maximize mean return with equal contribution to risk using modified ETL as the risk measure.
