\description{
This function aims to provide a wrapper for constrained optimization of 
portfolios that specify constraints and objectives.
}
\details{
This function currently supports DEoptim, random portfolios, pso, GenSA, ROI, osqp, Rglpk, mco, and CVXR solvers as back ends.
Additional back end contributions for Rmetrics, ghyp, etc. would be welcome.

When using random portfolios, search_size is precisely that, how many 
portfolios to test.  You need to make sure to set your feasible weights 
in generatesequence to make sure you have search_size unique 
portfolios to test, typically by manipulating the 'by' parameter 
to select something smaller than .01 
(I often use .002, as .001 seems like overkill)

When using DE, search_size is decomposed into two other parameters 
which it interacts with, NP and itermax.

NP, the number of members in each population, is set to cap at 2000 in 
DEoptim, and by default is the number of parameters (assets/weights) * 10.

itermax, if not passed in dots, defaults to the number of parameters (assets/weights) * 50.

When using GenSA and want to set \code{verbose=TRUE}, instead use \code{trace}. 

If \code{optimize_method="ROI"} is specified, a default solver will be 
selected based on the optimization problem. The \code{glpk} solver is the
default solver for LP and MILP optimization problems. The \code{quadprog} 
solver is the default solver for QP optimization problems. For example,
\code{optimize_method = "quadprog"} can be specified and the optimization
problem will be solved via ROI using the quadprog solver.

The extension to ROI solves a limited type of convex optimization problems:
\itemize{
\item{Maxmimize portfolio return subject leverage, box, group, position limit, target mean return, and/or factor exposure constraints on weights.}
\item{Minimize portfolio variance subject to leverage, box, group, turnover, and/or factor exposure constraints (otherwise known as global minimum variance portfolio).}
\item{Minimize portfolio variance subject to leverage, box, group, and/or factor exposure constraints and a desired portfolio return.}
\item{Maximize quadratic utility subject to leverage, box, group, target mean return, turnover, and/or factor exposure constraints and risk aversion parameter.
(The risk aversion parameter is passed into \code{optimize.portfolio} as an added argument to the \code{portfolio} object).}
\item{Maximize portfolio mean return per unit standard deviation (i.e. the Sharpe Ratio) can be done by specifying \code{maxSR=TRUE} in \code{optimize.portfolio}. 
If both mean and StdDev are specified as objective names, the default action is to maximize quadratic utility, therefore \code{maxSR=TRUE} must be specified to maximize Sharpe Ratio.}
\item{Minimize portfolio ES/ETL/CVaR optimization subject to leverage, box, group, position limit, target mean return, and/or factor exposure constraints and target portfolio return.}
\item{Maximize portfolio mean return per unit ES/ETL/CVaR (i.e. the STARR Ratio) can be done by specifying \code{maxSTARR=TRUE} in \code{optimize.portfolio}. 
If both mean and ES/ETL/CVaR are specified as objective names, the default action is to maximize mean return per unit ES/ETL/CVaR.}
}
These problems also support a weight_concentration objective where concentration
of weights as measured by HHI is added as a penalty term to the quadratic objective.

Because these convex optimization problem are standardized, there is no need for a penalty term. 
The \code{multiplier} argument in \code{\link{add.objective}} passed into the complete constraint object are ignored by the ROI solver.

If \code{optimize_method="CVXR"} is specified, a default solver will be selected based on the optimization problem.
The default solver for Linear Problem and Quadratic Programming will be \code{OSQP}, 
and the default solver for Second-Order Cone Programming will be \code{SCS}.
Specified CVXR solver can be given by using \code{optimize_method=c("CVXR", "CVXRsolver")}.
CVXR supports some commercial solvers, including CBC, CPLEX, GUROBI and MOSEK, and some open source solvers, including GLPK, GLPK_MI, OSQP, SCS and ECOS.
For example, \code{optimize_method = c("CVXR", "ECOS")} can be specified and the optimization problem will be solved via CVXR using the ECOS solver.

The extension to CVXR solves a limited type of convex optimization problems:
\itemize{
\item{Maxmimize portfolio mean return subject leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints}
\item{Minimize portfolio variance subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints (otherwise known as global minimum variance portfolio).}
\item{Maximize quadratic utility subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints and risk aversion parameter.
(The default risk aversion is 1, and specified risk aversion could be given by \code{risk_aversion = 1}. 
The risk aversion parameter is passed into \code{optimize.portfolio} as an added argument to the \code{portfolio} object.)}
\item{Minimize portfolio ES/ETL/CVaR optimization subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints and tail probability parameter.
(The default tail probability is 0.05, and specified tail probability could be given by \code{arguments = list(p=0.95)}.
The tail probability parameter is passed into \code{optimize.portfolio} as an added argument to the \code{portfolio} object.)}
\item{Minimize portfolio EQS optimization subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints and tail probability parameter.
(The default tail probability is 0.05, and specified tail probability could be given by \code{arguments = list(p=0.95)}.
The tail probability parameter is passed into \code{optimize.portfolio} as an added argument to the \code{portfolio} object.)}
\item{Maximize portfolio mean return per unit standard deviation (i.e. the Sharpe Ratio) subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints.
It should be specified by \code{maxSR=TRUE} in \code{optimize.portfolio} with both mean and var/StdDev objectives.
Otherwise, the default action is to maximize quadratic utility.}
\item{Maximize portfolio mean return per unit ES (i.e. the ES ratio/STARR) subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints.
It could be specified by \code{maxSTARR=TRUE} or \code{ESratio=TRUE} in \code{optimize.portfolio} with both mean and ES objectives.
The default action is to maximize ES ratio. If \code{maxSTARR=FALSE} or \code{ESratio=FALSE} is given, the action will be minimizing ES.}
\item{Maximize portfolio mean return per unit EQS (i.e. the EQS ratio) subject to leverage, box, group, and/or target mean return constraints.
It could be specified by \code{EQSratio=TRUE} in \code{optimize.portfolio} with both mean and EQS objectives.
The default action is to maximize EQS ratio. If \code{EQSratio=FALSE} is given, the action will be minimizing EQS.}
}

Because these convex optimization problem are standardized, there is no need for a penalty term. 
The \code{multiplier} argument in \code{\link{add.objective}} passed into the complete constraint object are ignored by the CVXR solver.
}
\note{
An object of class \code{v1_constraint} can be passed in for the \code{constraints} argument.
The \code{v1_constraint} object was used in the previous 'v1' specification to specify the 
constraints and objectives for the optimization problem, see \code{\link{constraint}}. 
We will attempt to detect if the object passed into the constraints argument 
is a \code{v1_constraint} object and update to the 'v2' specification by adding the 
constraints and objectives to the \code{portfolio} object.
